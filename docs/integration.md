## PSX

PSX is a framework dedicated to build REST APIs. All our components have evolved out of this framework but currently our
main focus is to develop and extend our framework independent components. The framework ist still in active use at
[Fusio](https://www.fusio-project.org/), which is an open source API management system. If you like to try a different
framework dedicated to API development feel free to check out the [repository](https://github.com/apioo/psx). Otherwise
you can also easily integrate our components into any existing framework.
