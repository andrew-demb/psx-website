# Introduction

PSX provides a modern set of framework independent components which help you to solve many problems in the API world.

- **[API](./api)**  
  Create a specification by either parsing an existing OpenAPI spec or by using PHP Attributes to annotate your code.
  Generate based on this specification either an OpenAPI spec or client SDKs in different languages.
- **[Schema](./schema)**  
  Create a schema by either parsing an existing [TypeSchema](https://typeschema.org/) spec or by using
  Plain-Old-PHP-Objects. Generate based on this schema models in different languages which allows you to re-use such
  schemas in different environments.
- **[Data](./data)**  
  Library to read and write data independent of a HTTP request/response object. It contains a reader and writer system
  and can be used to convert raw JSON payloads into an object graph.
- **[Model](./model)**  
  Contains a set of models which are automatically generated by the schema component. You can directly use these PHP
  models to i.e. generate a specification in a type-safe way.
- **[Integration](./integration)**  
  Describes ways how to integrate our components into existing frameworks.
